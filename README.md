The file included here is for somebody to show me how I can mirror the white object to match the red object. So I am mirroring the obejct with a Mirro Object at the world origin. I want to also flip the object to match the red object. But rotating the mirrror opbject on the X axis has no effect. It does allow rotations on Y and Z thought.

Maybe this is not possible?
